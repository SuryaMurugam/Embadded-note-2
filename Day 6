ARM :
   ARM is a family of RISC instruction set architectures (ISAs) for computer processors. 
Arm Ltd. develops the ISAs and licenses them to other companies, who build the physical 
devices that use the instruction set.

HISTORY:
    The applications of the ARM Process start with getting knowledge of the ARM Processorâ€™s history. 
Before ARM, x86 processors were used, which were launched in 1978. Whenever we remove the predefined 
instructions like complex instructions and hard-to-implement instructions, the remaining 
instructions take less power and pace and run faster, this is called Reduced Instruction 
Set Computer Architecture. x86 is a Complex Instruction Set Architecture . 


FEATURE:
    Multiprocessing System
    Tightly Coupled Memory
    Memory Management
    Thumb-2 Technology
    One-Cycle Execution Time
    Pipelining
    A large number of Registers

RISC: 
*simple but powerful instructionsthatexecute within a single cycle
at high clock speed. 
*Results in simple design and fast clock rate.
*The distinction blurs because CISC implements
RISC concepts.
